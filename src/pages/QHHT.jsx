        <h3>What is QHHT®?</h3>
        <p>
          Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT®) is a unique method developed
          by Dolores Cannon that involves inducing an individual into a deep
          state of hypnosis to connect with their Subconscious mind. This part
          of the self has unlimited knowledge and the ability to heal the
          physical body.
